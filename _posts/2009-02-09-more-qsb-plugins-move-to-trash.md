title: More QSB plugins - Move to Trash
---

I put together a really quick QSB plugin this evening - it adds an
action to move files to the Trash. This was another QuickSilver
convenience that I was missing.

I imagine this functionality will eventually make it into QSB proper,
but until then you can [grab the plugin
here](http://nparry.com/software/google-quicksearchbox-plugins/extra_file_actions/Google-QSB-ExtraFileActions-v0.1.zip)
if you are interested. The install process follows the same idea as my
[Delicious plugin
install](/2009/02/04/delicious-plugin-for-qsb-v0-2.html).
