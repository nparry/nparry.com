title: Updated ROT-13 QSB plugin
---

> Update: This version of the plugin has been superseded by [version 0.3](/2009/03/13/qsb-plugins-updated-for-vanadium.html).


I noticed my first try at a ROT-13 plugin for QSB did not nicely display big
chunks of text - I've updated it to use a smaller font size.  Pre-built version
is
