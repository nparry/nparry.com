title: Has no one else done this already?
---

Imagine that you have an address book, full of people. People have
birthdays - birthdays are one of the many things you forget. Imagine
further that you use an online calendar. Wouldn't it be nice if those
birthdays automatically showed up on your calendar? Yet I can't seem to
find a free app to push birthdays from my Address Book to Google
calendar.

In disbelief I've started to [write my
own](https://github.com/nparry/birthdaysync/tree/master), but someone else must
have already done this, or I'm missing some obvious built-in way to do it.
Anyone?
