title: QSB plugins updated for Vanadium
---

> Update: These plugins have been [updated for QSB Manganese.](/2009/05/29/qsb-plugins-updated-for-maganese.html).


QSB Vanadium [was
released](https://groups.google.com/group/qsb-mac-discuss/browse_thread/thread/a46b037045ec11b1)
a few days back. I've updated my plugins to work with the changes in this
version.

* [Delicious plugin](https://assets.nparry.com/software/google-quicksearchbox-plugins/delicious/Google-QSB-Delicious-v0.3.zip).
* [ROT-13 plugin](https://assets.nparry.com/software/google-quicksearchbox-plugins/rot13/Google-QSB-Rot13-v0.3.zip).

The install is the usual - download, unzip, move to
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Quick Search Box/PlugIns

I dropped my 'Move to Trash' plugin since it looks like that is now
built-in to QSB.

For the 'it-works-on-my-machine' disclaimer, I'm using QSB version 2.0.0
(2.0.0.1053) according to the "About Google Quick Search Box" info.
