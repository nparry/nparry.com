title: Delicious QSB plugin + Yahoo based accounts
---

A long standing issue with the Delicious plugin for QSB has been that it didn't
work with Yahoo based accounts. Well, [it should work
now](http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac-plugins/issues/detail?id=5). Hopefully
I'll have the source pushed up to the svn repo in a few days.
